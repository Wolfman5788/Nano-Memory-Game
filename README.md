In this Fend Udacity project, I have created a memory game in which matching two of the same cards make a match and remain revealed. When cards are opened that don't match, they hide again. The game is won when all cards have been matched, and a pop-up appears congratulating the player as well as displaying the time it took to complete, number of moves,star rating, and an option to play again.

In order to install the game, download this set from github : https://github.com/Wolfman5788/Nano-Memory-Game.git

Open index.html using a web browser
Start game by clicking on a card

Instructions:

Click on any two cards. If they match, continue looking for other matches.
Repeat until all cards have been matched.
A pop-up modal should display congratulating you and giving you the option to play again.
If the there are any game-breaking bugs, you can hit the restart button on the top to reset the board.

Bugs List:
If you click on cards too rapidly, you may be able to display 3 or even 4 cards at a time, athough any displayed before the first two hide will not match even if they are the same
